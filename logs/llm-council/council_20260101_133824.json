  "question": "Analyze the budget navigation structure in a macOS SwiftUI wedding planning app. The current implementation has a 'double nav' setup that the user dislikes:

1. **Main App Sidebar** (AppSidebarView.swift): Contains top-level navigation items including 'Budget' under 'Budget & Finances' section
2. **Budget Sub-Sidebar** (BudgetSidebarView.swift): When Budget is selected, shows a secondary sidebar with 12 budget-related views organized into 4 collapsible groups:
   - Overview (5 items): Budget Dashboard, Analytics Hub, Account Cash Flow, Budget Development, Calculator
   - Expenses (3 items): Expense Tracker, Expense Reports, Expense Categories
   - Payments (1 item): Payment Schedule
   - Gifts & Owed (3 items): Money Tracker, Money Received, Money Owed

The current implementation uses HStack with a 240px fixed-width sidebar + Divider + content area.

**Problems:**
1. Double navigation feels cluttered and takes up too much horizontal space
2. The budget sidebar is always visible even when not needed
3. Inconsistent with other modules (Guests, Vendors, Timeline) which don't have sub-sidebars

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain access to all 12 budget views
- Should work well in compact windows (<700px)
- Should follow macOS design patterns
- Must integrate with existing NavigationSplitView architecture

**Request:** Propose 3-4 alternative navigation patterns for the budget module that would:
1. Reduce visual clutter
2. Be more consistent with other modules
3. Work well at all window sizes
4. Maintain discoverability of all budget features

For each alternative, provide:
- Description of the pattern
- Pros and cons
- Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- Recommended for this use case (Yes/No with reasoning)",

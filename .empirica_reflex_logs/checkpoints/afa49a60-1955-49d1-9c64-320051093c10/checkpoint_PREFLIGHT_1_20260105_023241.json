    "reasoning": "Starting Phase 6.1 dashboard layout work. I understand the current implementation uses GeometryReader with maxItems calculation, but the layout still has issues: cards not filling space properly, scrolling still present, and data-dense cards (guests, vendors) showing too few items. Need to research space-filling algorithms and implement a solution that eliminates scrolling while maximizing data visibility.",

I have moderate knowledge of the design system (know=0.60) and understand the task requirements (clarity=0.70). Context is good from reviewing open tabs showing color system work (context=0.65). Uncertainty is moderate (0.40) as I need to locate existing V6 patterns and identify what values may be missing from design system. No work completed yet (completion=0.00). Ready to investigate and implement.",

    "reasoning": "Successfully completed Step 5: Conditional card rendering. Added 6 computed properties for visibility checks and helper data. Wrapped 4 cards in conditional statements while keeping Budget Overview and Task Manager always visible. Implementation was straightforward - no edge cases encountered. Build succeeded, changes committed and pushed. Completion 1.00 as Step 5 is fully done. High know/do (0.90) from clear requirements. Very low uncertainty (0.10) - implementation matched plan exactly. Impact 0.75 as this improves UX by hiding empty cards.",

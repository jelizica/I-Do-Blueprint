This is more complex than previous steps - need to use GeometryReader to calculate available height, create adaptive item limits per card, and potentially extract a DynamicDashboardGrid component. Know is 0.70 because I understand the goal but haven't implemented GeometryReader-based layouts before in this codebase. Do is 0.65 as this requires careful height calculations. Uncertainty is 0.45 around edge cases with different window sizes and how to best structure the component. No work completed yet (completion=0, impact=0).",

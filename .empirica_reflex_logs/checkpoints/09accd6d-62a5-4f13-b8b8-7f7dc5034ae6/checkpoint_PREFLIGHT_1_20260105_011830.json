    "reasoning": "Starting Dashboard V7 implementation continuation. I have read the handoff document showing Steps 1-3 are complete (refresh button removed, budget data fixed, payments updated). I understand the remaining work: Step 4 (guest avatars), Step 5 (conditional rendering), Step 6 (space-filling layout). I have moderate knowledge of the codebase structure from the handoff and implementation plan. Uncertainty is moderate because I need to verify the current state of the code and understand the exact implementation details. No work completed yet (completion=0, impact=0). Change potential is moderate as this is UI enhancement work.",

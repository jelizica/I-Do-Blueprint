    "reasoning": "PREFLIGHT Assessment for Guest Management Dashboard Conversion:\n\nKNOW (0.75): Strong understanding of SwiftUI, design system, and repository pattern. Familiar with existing dashboard patterns (DashboardViewV7). Need to explore GuestStoreV2 implementation details and Supabase schema for guests table.\n\nDO (0.80): Confident in SwiftUI view creation, design token usage, and store integration. Have successfully implemented similar dashboard cards. Need to verify exact Supabase query patterns for guest statistics.\n\nCONTEXT (0.85): Excellent project context from Cold Start Protocol. Know design system location, store patterns, repository structure. Understand glassmorphism is NOT part of design system (uses AppColors semantic colors instead).\n\nCLARITY (0.80): Task is clear - convert HTML to Swift matching existing aesthetics. Some ambiguity around glassmorphism vs design system colors, and whether to create new view or enhance existing guest views.\n\nCOHERENCE (0.85): Task aligns well with existing architecture. Will follow V2 store pattern, use GuestStoreV2, implement with design tokens, query via repository.\n\nSIGNAL (0.75): HTML provides good visual reference. Need to extract key components: header, stats cards, filters, guest grid. Some noise around Tailwind classes that don't map directly to SwiftUI.\n\nDENSITY (0.70): Moderate information density. HTML is verbose with Tailwind classes. Need to distill to core components and data requirements.\n\nSTATE (0.80): Project is in good state - Phase 6 just completed, build succeeds, design system is mature. Ready for new feature work.\n\nCHANGE (0.60): Moderate scope - new view creation, stats calculations, Supabase queries. Will touch GuestStoreV2, possibly add new repository methods, create new view file.\n\nCOMPLETION (0.00): Starting fresh - no work done yet.\n\nIMPACT (0.70): High user value - guest management is core wedding planning feature. Will improve guest list UX significantly.\n\nUNCERTAINTY (0.25): Low uncertainty. Clear patterns to follow, mature codebase, good documentation. Main unknowns: exact Supabase schema fields, whether stats are pre-calculated or need aggregation.",
